# 🍅 Pomodoro Timer
# No external dependencies! Just pure Python magic.
#
# What we use from Python's standard library:
# - time: Makes the timer tick
# - os: Clears your screen so it looks nice
# - datetime: Keeps track of when you worked
# - json: Saves your awesome progress
#
# That's literally it. Super simple, super powerful!
